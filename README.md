# üöÄ Terraform Azure Environments & Reusable VNet Module

## üß† Challenge Overview

This project is a submission for the Azure Terraform Infrastructure Challenge, showcasing reusable Terraform modules, multi-environment infrastructure provisioning, and GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows.

- **Module Repo:** [terraform-azure-vnet-module](https://github.com/santhosh-chindam/terraform-azure-vnet-module)
- **Environment Repo:** [terraform-azure-environments](https://github.com/santhosh-chindam/terraform-azure-environments)

---

## üì¶ Objective

- ‚úÖ Build a **reusable Terraform module** to provision an Azure Virtual Network (VNet).
- ‚úÖ Use this module to **create multiple environments** (e.g., dev, test, prod).
- ‚úÖ Add additional resources like **VM**, **Storage Account**, and **Public IP**.
- ‚úÖ Deploy using a **GitHub Actions workflow**.
- ‚úÖ Emphasize **clean code**, **secure practices**, and **scalability**..

üîÅ Module Usage
Module: terraform-azure-vnet-module
Features:
Creates a Virtual Network, Subnets, Network Security Groups, and NSG associations.

Accepts configurable variables for name, address space, subnets, tags, and more.

Outputs:

VNet name and ID

Subnet names and IDs

Resource group and location

Example Use:

üåç Multi-Environment Setup
Secrets are configured in the GitHub repository environments (via Settings > Environments), and the respective secret values must be updated accordingly.
Scalable (add more envs easily)

Maintainable (central logic in the module)

Secure (environment-level secrets)

‚öôÔ∏è Resources Created
‚úÖ Core Infrastructure
Virtual Network (VNet)

Subnets

Network Security Group (NSG)

‚úÖ Additional Resources
Linux Virtual Machine

Public IP (Standard, Static)

Azure Storage Account

üîê GitHub Actions Workflow
File: .github/workflows/terraform-deploy.yml
‚úÖ Features
Triggered manually via workflow_dispatch with dropdowns:

environment (dev/test/production)

region (eastus, westeurope, etc.)

Uses a matrix strategy but only deploys selected environment.

Includes steps:

Checkout

Setup Terraform

init, validate, plan, apply (if main branch)

Uses GitHub Secrets per environment:

AZURE_CLIENT_ID

AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET

AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID

AZURE_TENANT_ID

üöÄ Deployment Steps
Go to Actions tab ‚Üí Run workflow.

Choose the environment and region.

Click Run.

Only the selected environment will be deployed.

üß™ Terraform Plan Output
Example plan output (for dev):

Run terraform plan -input=false -var="environment=dev" -var="location=eastus"

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution
plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:
